    "Difference between built-in functions and user-defined functions:\n",
    "Built-in functions: These functions are provided as part of the Python language itself. They are ready to use and do not require any additional code or definitions. Built-in functions are typically used for common tasks and operations in Python. Examples of built-in functions include print(), len(), and max(). Here's an example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "#Built-in function example\n",
    "length = len(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "print(length)  # Output: 13\n",
    "User-defined functions: These functions are created by the users themselves to perform specific tasks or operations. Users define the function by providing a name, input parameters, and the desired functionality. User-defined functions can be customized to suit specific requirements. Here's an example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "#User-defined function example\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add_numbers(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8"

    "Passing arguments to a function in Python:\n",
    "Positional arguments: These arguments are passed to a function based on their position or order. The arguments are matched with the function parameters in the same order. The number and position of arguments must match the function's parameter list.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def greet(name, age):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", name, \"! You are\", age, \"years old.\")\n",

    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "Hello Alice ! You are 25 years old.\n",

    "Keyword arguments: These arguments are passed to a function using the argument name along with the value. The order of the arguments does not matter in this case, as they are matched based on their names. Keyword arguments provide more flexibility when calling a function.\n",

    "Purpose of the return statement in a function:\n",
    "The return statement in a function is used to specify the value that the function should return when it is called. It allows the function to provide an output or result back to the calling code. The return statement also terminates the execution of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can have multiple return statements, but only one of them will be executed. When a return statement is encountered, the function exits immediately, and the specified value is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def find_max(numbers):\n",
    "    if len(numbers) == 0:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "\n",
    "    max_num = numbers[0]\n",

    "print(max_number)  # Output: 10\n",
    "In this example, the find_max() function returns the maximum number from a list of numbers. The first return None statement handles the case when the input list is empty. The subsequent return max_num statement is executed."

    "Local scope: Variables defined inside a function have local scope. They are only accessible within the function itself. Local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function returns or terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global scope: Variables defined outside any function or at the top level of a module have global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the code, including inside functions. Global variables are created when the module is imported or when they are explicitly defined, and they persist throughout the program execution.\n",

    "Using the return statement to return multiple values:\n",
    "In Python, a function can return multiple values by separating them with commas in the return statement. The values are returned as a tuple, which can then be unpacked or accessed as needed.\n",

    "Difference between \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference\" concepts:\n",
    "In Python, all function arguments are passed by value, but the behavior can appear similar to pass by reference in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass by value: When a function is called with a variable as an argument, a copy of the value is created and passed to the function. Any modifications made to the parameter variable inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass by reference (continued):\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there is no explicit pass by reference. However, when passing mutable objects like lists or dictionaries as arguments, the reference to the object is passed. This means that changes made to the object inside the function will be reflected outside the function as well.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
